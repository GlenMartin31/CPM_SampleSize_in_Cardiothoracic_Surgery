# Statistical Primer: sample size considerations for developing and validating clinical prediction models 

This repo gives the code required to run the worked examples within the paper entitled "Statistical Primer: sample size considerations for developing and validating clinical prediction models", within the European Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. 

The code is based on the original publications for sample size requirements for developing and validating clinical prediction models (listed below). See the "pmsampsize" R/Stata package for full implementation of the sample size formula for model development, and the "pmvalsampsize" R/Stata package for full implementation of the sample size formula for model validation.
